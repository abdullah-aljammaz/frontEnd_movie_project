It took me 4 years to start the show and it was worth the wait. It&#39;s a must watch if you&#39;re a fan of The Witcher or a fantasy lover. The acting is great and Anya (Yen) nearly carries all of S1 on her vulnerable shoulders. Ciri is key….</p>

                            <p class="review" slot="content">There are moments of cosmic enchantment, magical little moments where the royalty dance under starry ceilings, where Love is destined to a cursed knight and a lovelorn princess as they float in the timeless eye of a storm as the banquet hall erupts in chaos, with angelic harmonies hauntingly emanating in the audiences ears. The macabre monstrosities make for an intriguing environment and the tragic curses of childless lovers who cannot carry on their bloodlines, or the fairytale stories that deal more blood than Hope, make for an enthralling continuance. But the tired tropes that make a black-and-white statement of grey areas weigh this down: like the elves being ousted of their land by high civilization, the originators of magic that was stolen by the humans, essentially setting up for the series that monsters are not so bad, and humans are more monstrous than most, but the writers will always have a human (or sub-human) to virtue their piety above the rest of humanity. Also, the repeated theme that women are just vessels of flesh for mens&#39; traditions,, yet presented as the strong and pious types, especially when they are a tribe of only women, or a coven of only sorceresses. These both ignore the history of mankind, where women were just as much a part of enforcing suppressive traditions, especially in the name of royalty, and where tribal groups were as brutal and suppressive as any king&#39;s army.</p>

So satisfying, so good and learned so much about his composure.
